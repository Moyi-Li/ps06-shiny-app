## Brief description of the data
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. It included 16598 rows and 11 columns, including the name, releasing platform, year, genre, publisher, sales in global and each region, and rank of overall sales.

## Widgets and panels
**On the first page**, the widget includes general information and the main panel includes the sample data for the dataset.

**On the second page**, the widget includes three drop-down menus to select the desired x variable, y variable, and appropriate color to plot the dataset. There is one reactive summary on the bottom of the data plot.

**On the third page**, users can freely select the checkbox on the widget to determine which columns they want to display on the main panel. Users can also select the numbers of rows to display on the page. As it is time-consuming to display all rows of the dataset, I only set the maximum to 200 here. There is one reactive description on the top of the data table.
